# 🐍 Learning Python with Codédex

Welcome to my **PYTHON** repository!

This project contains all the exercises I complete as part of my journey learning **Python** through the [Codédex](https://www.codedex.io/) platform.

Each file here represents an exercise or practice based on a concept I’ve learned. I use this repo to:

- Apply the concepts I study
- Track my progress
- Easily review what I’ve learned

I commit each exercise after completing it to keep a clear record of my progress.

## 📌 Notes

This repository is constantly evolving as I continue learning. The files are intentionally simple to reflect the fundamentals and Python logic as taught on Codédex.
